CS50's Track: Web

This is a very simple application created for purely academic learning, for a CS50 module. For this reason there are also no views & no set up code, & I've not released it to the public. This is mainly due to the fact that I didn't know how to do that when developing this site.  

To view this application, I simply run "python3 -m http.server" from the command line. The server details are found in the "http-server.py" file.
