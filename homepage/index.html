            <p> 
                I am Andrea Folgado, from Cape Town, South Africa, and I've lived in few countries including Spain & The UK. I have 3 families, across Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK and the US.
                So I've moved to the UK to build a life here, with the hope I can spend more time with my family members on this side of the world. <a href="about.html">Read more...</a>

            <p> 
                I would like to share a little something about each of the places where I've lived or visited:

            <h2 class="heading-format"> Cape Town</h2>
                <p> Since I'm proudly Cape Tonian, it seems only fair that I start with my home city! We have beautiful beaches and we have sunshine three Quarters of the year. We have been known for our wines in Stellenbosch, but we also have craft wines, beers and ciders. Sorry to the English, but I just don't like their ciders sadly. So I've taken more to drinking beer since we've been here. One beer my partner and I really enjoy in Cape Town, is the CBC Amber Weiss - its a lovely combination of sweet and crisp, freshness. Sadly it's not common here.
                    Early last year my partner accidentally discovered a really good pastry shop in Cape Town who also have realllly good coffee. If you're in Cape Town, definitely make a point to go to <a href="https://www.jasonbakery.co.za/"> Jason's bakery!</a> Their pastries were absolutely delicious and their coffee was so good, you want it black so you can taste all the flavours (Trust me on this one!). <strong> Warning:</strong> It's really addictive - you may end up going several times! 
                    One thing they do that I've found nowehere else: an almond croissant where the almond paste is in <strong>ALL</strong> the layers of the croissant - delivering a subtle but distinct almond taste that <strong>adds</strong> to the butter without overpowering it. I hate the almond paste being in the center because it becomes the only thing you taste. To make things better, they're not the only people offering really good coffee. We also have plenty craft coffees, jams, cheeses etc.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Also: Don't worry, a good majority of people in Cape Town speak English. It's often be categorized as a slice of Europe in Africa. It's nowhere near as old as Europe but it definitely has its own fair share of history - Both good and bad!
                    We do have quite the diverse variety of peoples, cultures, languages and religions. South Africa is definitely a first-world country in many ways, but you definitely want an official local guide to help you navigate around - both to show you the really beautiful areas and to avoid the really dangerous ones. South Africa's definitely the country where you want to blend in - aka preferably don't look like a foreigner LOL.

            <h2 class="heading-format"> London </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the 2nd time I've lived in London but the majority of these pictures will be recent. My partner and I moved to London in October, 2019, so it was only 5 months before this Covid started causing chaos world-wide. 
                    Sadly haven't seen much of London as a result. So most of these pictures will be local to where we stay (Canada Water, SE16).

            <h2 class="heading-format"> Spain</h2>
                <p> 
                    Took these pictures back in 2006 so I have to apologise for the quality of the photos. When I moved to Spain, in 2007, I lived in a small town called Los Barrios. It was on the SouthWest coast of Spain, close to the city Algeciras and 2 hours drive from Malaga. No one spoke English so it was an interesting adventure to learn Spanish and I definitely appreciated the lessons taught at the community centre! As my Spanish improved, I developed friendships with our neighbour (and home owner) and with my (then) partner's parents.
                    It was a beautiful town to live in - not sure how things are at the moment. Wow, did it get humid!!! 
                    Fun times!
                </p>
