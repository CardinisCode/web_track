        <hr class="heading-br">
        <p>
            I am Andrea Folgado, from Cape Town, South Africa, and I've lived in few countries including Spain & The UK.
            I have 3 families, across Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK and the US.
            So I've moved to the UK to build a life here, with the hope I can spend more time with my family members on
            this side of the world. <a class="general_links" href="about.html">Read more...</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I would like to share a little something about each of the places where I've lived or visited:
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="heading-format"> Cape Town</h2>
        <p> Since I'm proudly Cape Tonian, it seems only fair that I start with my home city! We have beautiful beaches
            and we have sunshine three Quarters of the year. We have been known for our wines in Stellenbosch, but we
            also have craft wines, beers and ciders. Sorry to the English, but I just don't like their ciders sadly. So
            I've taken more to drinking beer since we've been here. One beer my partner and I really enjoy in Cape Town,
            is the CBC Amber Weiss - its a lovely combination of sweet and crisp, freshness. Sadly it's not common here.
            Early last year my partner accidentally discovered a really good pastry shop in Cape Town who also have
            realllly good coffee. If you're in Cape Town, definitely make a point to go to <a class="general_links"
                href="https://www.jasonbakery.co.za/"> Jason's bakery!</a> Their pastries were absolutely delicious and
            their coffee was so good, you want it black so you can taste all the flavours (Trust me on this one!).
            <strong> Warning:</strong> It's really addictive - you may end up going several times!
            One thing they do that I've found nowehere else: an almond croissant where the almond paste is in
            <strong>ALL</strong> the layers of the croissant - delivering a subtle but distinct almond taste that
            <strong>adds</strong> to the butter without overpowering it. I hate the almond paste being in the center
            because it becomes the only thing you taste. To make things better, they're not the only people offering
            really good coffee. We also have plenty craft coffees, jams, cheeses etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also: Don't worry, a good majority of people in Cape Town speak English. It's often be categorized as a
            slice of Europe in Africa. It's nowhere near as old as Europe but it definitely has its own fair share of
            history - Both good and bad!
            We do have quite the diverse variety of peoples, cultures, languages and religions. South Africa is
            definitely a first-world country in many ways, but you definitely want an official local guide to help you
            navigate around - both to show you the really beautiful areas and to avoid the really dangerous ones. South
            Africa's definitely the country where you want to blend in - aka preferably don't look like a foreigner LOL.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="heading-format"> London </h2>
        <p>
            This is the 2nd time I've lived in London but the majority of these pictures will be recent. My partner and
            I moved to London in October, 2019, so it was only 5 months before this Covid started causing chaos
            world-wide.
            Sadly haven't seen much of London as a result. So most of these pictures will be local to where we stay
            (Canada Water, SE16).
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="heading-format"> Spain</h2>
        <p>
            Took these pictures back in 2006 so I have to apologise for the quality of the photos. When I moved to
            Spain, in 2007, I lived in a small town called Los Barrios. It was on the SouthWest coast of Spain, close to
            the city Algeciras and 2 hours drive from Malaga. No one spoke English so it was an interesting adventure to
            learn Spanish and I definitely appreciated the lessons taught at the community centre! As my Spanish
            improved, I developed friendships with our neighbour (and home owner) and with my (then) partner's parents.
            It was a beautiful town to live in - not sure how things are at the moment. Wow, did it get humid!!!
            Fun times!
        </p>

                            I stayed with my sister in New Jersey for 3 months (in 2008), and since she worked in Lower
                            Manhattan, New York, I'd occassionally take the train with her to NY. I would walk around
                            New York city and talk to local South Americans. Having just lived in Spain for almost a
                            year, I could engage in conversation. 
                        </p>    
                        <p> Being a young 21 year old lady, able to speak Spanish, and friendly... let's just say they were over the moon in happiness! The plan was for me to
                            stay in the US and find a college/Uni that would have me.
                            I was not in a great place at the time, since I'd just come out of a relationship with my
                            first love. Plus I wasn't resourceful at the time, so I had no clue how to organize & secure
                            a loan and to sort out the required paperwork that would allow me to legally stay in the US.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My sister definitely made my 21st birthday epic. She really did spoil me! She took me to
                            dinner, we went to another place for a drink, before going out to dance with her friends. I
                            loved it :D Still remember how her friends encircled me to protect me from other people in
                            the club. In hindsight, that was a fantastic idea and I definitely needed it. I was really
                            naive at the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we split up and moved to 2 different countries as kids, we grew up apart. So those 3
                            months allowed us to spend personal time with each other, as adults. Although I wasn't in
                            the best mental & emotional space, I'm definitely glad I had that opportunity!
                        </p>

                        <p>I've only been to Portugal twice though I only have memories of the 2nd trip. I do have a few
                            memories of that time but they're a little vague since it was over 20 years ago. </p>

                        <p>
                            I've been to Switzerland quite a few times over the years, since my uncle has lived in
                            Switzerland for over 20 years. We've spent a few Christmas holidays in Switzerland, which is
                            awesome because it gave us a white christmas. Ironically we often spent a good portion of
                            that time indoors hehe.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Here a few memories I can share:</p>
                        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                            <li> One year my father decided it would be really cool for us to drive to Switzerland - I
                                think he was just trying to avoid having to fly there LOL. OMW that car trip... to give
                                you an idea imagine 3 kids including 1 teenager and 2 adults struggling to get along. My
                                dad even got lost once and ended up going around a roundabout a good handful of times
                                LOL. This was before maps were available on your phone so people still relied on old
                                school physical maps. Not sure I'd ever do that again hehe I'd be more than happy to fly
                                anytime!</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li> Taking the train to the center of Zurich, and walking about between the houses and
                                businesses. I can remember some of those pathways were cobblestoned and narrow, giving a
                                lovely antigue look and vibe. </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li> My aunt would bake really delicious fresh bread whenever we were there. Her baking
                                skills are amazing!</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li> We went ice skating which was cool but it terrified me. Knowing how easily you could
                                lose your fingers was a terrifying concept to me, not to mention that I had no sense of balance
                                LOL So my uncle held my hand and took me to the very center of the rink, and thankfully
                                never let go LOL. I was both happy and anxious at the same time! I definitely
                                appreciated how he made a point to make sure I felt included. He'd often strike up
                                conversation with me and check in with me to see how I was doing. We still have a good
                                relationship to this day. </li>
                        </ul>
