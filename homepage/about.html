                <p> 
                    I am Andrea Folgado, from Cape Town, South Africa and I have been living in London for the past year. I have spent the majority of this year studying as I would like to <a class="general_links" href="career_change.html">career change</a> into Software Engineering, starting as a Junior Software Developer. 
                    Although I love Cape Town, I moved to the UK as I would love to travel around the UK and Europe, and to spend more time with my family in the UK, Portugal and Switzerland.  I would, especially, love to see my grandmother (in Portugal), give her a hug and to spend some time with her person. 
                    I love learning and I'm interested in both Medicinal and Psycological healthcare. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I've found a new love for learning and I'm realizing just how inquisitive I am. Gotta love when your brain wakes up around 12am and wants to answer all sorts of questions LOL!
                    Part of what made finding a career so challenging through the years was that I was interested in all areas of expertise - medicine, psychology, journalism, architecture, Interior Design...to name a few. 
                    I finally decided I needed to actually make up my mind, choose one career and just commit full-heartingly. I had to face the reality that getting into the wrong career isn't a death sentence. If it doesn't work out for me, I can change careers again and I'll walk away with new skills.
                    The career I chose? Well it was none of the above LOL I chose to go into Software Engineering. Completely different I know but I did dip my toes into the water first, by taking a shot at <a class="general_links" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>. I found it new, exciting, mentally stimulating and challenging. I was keen! 
                    Thus my new <a class="general_links" href="career_change.html">journey</a> began! 
                </p>
    
                <p> I remember back in school I could get C's just from the classroom lessons & homework. Yet I hated exams! When I had to prepare for the exams, I'd often end up falling asleep half way through. It was a draining experience trying to just remember content (putting Medicine, Psychology and Law out the window LOL). 
                    One thing that does appeal to me about Software Engineering is that although there is some theory, it's still mostly practical. I can learn from just doing and experimenting. Even best practices, TestDrivenDevelopment and Aguile practices can learnt as you code or as you work with others in a work environment. 
                    Plus there are many avenues for growth within the software engineering field, and there's always Security & white-hat hatting. Seeing / hearing people passionate about their field definitely does help one decide which fields are interesting to consider. 
                    That said, I am definitely keen to explore (for myself) various different roles to see which ones personally interest me.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Professionally, I do take initiative when I recognize opportunities to help my colleagues and/or managers. 
                    I enjoy training and offering support to fellow colleagues and managers. I take customer service very seriously and I strongly believe in helping the customer find the products & services that meet their personal needs.
                    I have come to realize I have a strong moral compass, and I believe in honest, integrity, friendliness, and being true to yourself. I can be passionate, tenacious and idealistic, but I definitely submit to good reason.  Both my sister and a close friend have both suggested journalism to me for this reason. 
                    I do hope to pick up a journalism course at some point, as its definitely one of the fields I find fascinating. You never know...
