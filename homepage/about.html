        <h1> About Andi </h1>
        <p></p>
        <p  class="body_padding"> I am Andrea Folgado, from Cape Town, South Africa. I have been living in London for the past year and I have spent the majority of this year <a href="career_change.html">studying</a>.
            I moved to the UK as I would love to travel Europe and to spend more time with my family in the UK, Portugal and Switzerland. My partner and I spent Christmas (2019) with my family in Portsmouth (UK), and my brothers and sister joined us.
            I really enjoyed that! We have also managed to spend a little time with my brothers & sister here in London, but sadly not often thanks to Covid.
        </p>
        <p  class="body_padding"> To give a little background, I moved to the UK back in Dec 2001 to stay with my dad, stepmom and my brothers. My dad and my stepmom split up and divorced a few years later, and I moved to London in 2004 to stay with my dad.
            Sadly my dad chose the course I did at college, and I ended up hating it.
            I never really did well at that course but at least I have 2 A levels from it. As the course came to an end, my dad told me I would need to move out as he wants to have his own space.  </p>

        <p class="body_padding">
            I enjoy playing board games and computer games, when I have the opportunity to play with other people. I love face to face interaction and prefer it over distance communication, so Covid has really left me feeling isolated and cut off.
            Since moving to the UK, I've struggled to figure out which hobby I'd enjoy taking up. Since I'd prefer a hobby which involves face-to-face interaction with other people, it will have to wait until this Covid virus is under control again.
            The only form of exercise that I enjoy is walking or dancing. I found I have a problem with my balance and eye coordination. So I don't do well with sports which involve something coming at me and me having to respond at the right time and place.
            I do enjoy swimming, especially along the bottom of a pool but not in clorinated pools - chlorine takes the fun out of it in my opinion.
