            <h2> 2020</h2>
            <p>
                2020 has been an interesting year with an abundance of challenges. I have seen both my physical and mental health affected as a result of this virus
                and the restrictions that have come with it. I know I am definitely not the only one to be affected neither. So I would like to share my story of how
                I've been affected by COVID, the restrictions and my views on the matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                I emigrated to London, UK, in October 2019. I had hoped to spend more time with my family both in the UK and in Europe. At the beginning of the year,
                my partner and I started making plans to take a holiday in Portugal. I really wanted to spend time with my aunt & uncle but also my grandmother. I had not seen any of my family members in person since I was 10 years old.
                That's a good 20 years ago. We were worried when COVID reached Europe, but our plans went out the window when the cases in Spain started to rise exponentially. Portugal took precautions: they pretty much closed their country and introduced restrictions.
                Their early response definitely paid off for their country and it was evident in their case numbers.
                So our holiday plans have been put on hold for a undetermined amount of time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In mid March, my partner and I started to feel unwell, but nothing more than a dry cough and sniffles. I remember mine started off dry and I got a dry cough.
                It felt like I had hayfever and a minor flu in one. I do remember that cough lasting for roughly a month after all the other symptoms faded away.
                Nothing epic but my partner was advised to start working from home just in case.
                A little over a week later, his company decided to tell all employees who could work remotely to do so. It's October now and he's been working from home since March.
                We were especially cautious during the first few months. We didn't make plans with friends or family. We simply out to get food at the local Sainsburys, or to take a walk in the local area.
            </p>

            <p>
                Towards the end of March I had pain on the right side of my stomach. I've had pain more intense than this, but I wanted to make sure it wasnt serious.
                So I logged it with the Dr IQ app on my phone, which is linked to the clinic I'm registered to. On a call with a doctor, I described the pain I had and where I was experiencing it.
                The doctor set up an appointment to see him, and in the session he felt the area around where I had the pain. Since the pain was located really close to where my appendix is.
                So he referred me to the nearest hospital for testing, to make sure it wasn't the appendix causing the pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I arrived at the hospital, a nurse took my temperature and it was a little higher than it should be. So I was redirected to the Covid section of the waiting room.
                A doctor came to fetch me and directed me to a bed, where 2 nurses took my temperature. Whilst I was there, the doctor examined my stomach and ran a few tests. Thankfully it was not appendicitis.
                That said, since it was not appendicitis, they were prepared to dishcarge me without exploring the cause of the pain. The doctor put it down to IBS and she came off as being very dismissive when I asked questions on what I should do.
                I got the strong sense that now my pain wasn't caused by something urgent, I should not waste any time leaving the hospital. *Sigh* The nurses did take my temperate several times during the time I was in hospital, and I very much got the sense they would not have released me until my temperate was within the acceptable range.
            </p>

            <p>
                I won't name the hospital as this is not to shame the hospital. This is pretty much thanks to the virus. They can't afford to have people in the hospital any longer than absolutely needed to avoid/minimise the transmission of the virus.
                It's just really frustrating as it seems professionals can't really advise on Colon pain or refer one to a specialist as colon pain isn't an urgent matter - in the bigger picture.
                I can say however that my stomach has caused me a great deal of frustration and concern. My stomach has grown constantly over the course of this year. In terms of trouser sizes, over the course of this year I've gone from 12 -> 14 -> 20.
                I do not have constipation since I don't meet the requirements. I am not pregnant as I get my regular cycles yet I look well over 6 months pregnant. Yet I've had people look at me or even ask if I'm pregnant.
                It definitely seems to be a combination of fat and bloating. I hate anything tight around my stomach and there are times when I can't stand anything sitting on my stomach.
            </p>

            <p>
                In April, I found I started getting rashes on my hands.I had never experienced anything like this in South Africa. I have also previously lived in the United Kingdom, from Dec 2001 to early 2007. Yet during this time
                I don't recall ever experiencing such skin problems. I discovered that washing the dishes and washing my hair both caused a rash, so I started using gloves for both. I thankfully found a skin-friendly shampoo and we replaced the showerhead, removing the need for gloves when washing my hair.
                I had to stop using all the creams I had before and I switched over to E45's body cream for ezcema. I found my hands were getting irritated after I washed my hands, so I stopped using general handwash for general handwashing and reserved it for when I enter the apartment.
                At one point I had got eczema on my hand between 2 fingers. Oh my word was that itchy, irritating and frustrating! I managed to get an eczema cream which helped with the itchiness. I think it took something like 2-3 weeks to go away. This taught me to ensure that I dried my hands properly when washing my hands.
            </p>

            <p>
                May came with it's own challenge: Asthma! I know I had asthma for a few years as a kid, and my mom confirmed I had asthma for the first two years of my life. I suspect I've had asthma attacks over the years but I didn't know what I was experiencing. So I would just wait it out.
                I remember being easily out of breath when trying to participate in sports growing up but I put that down to being unfit. I had the same approach when doing any type of physical activity. So I've always preferred walking over any other form of exercise. I've had nights over the past 10 years where I would find myself lying in my bed and feeling out of breath,
                despite doing no exercise at all. Yet I figured it could be a spiritual attack since I was trying to connect with God.
                In May, I woke up one morning feeling short of breath like I was fighting for my every breath. I tried to lie on my side but it did nothing to help. So I sat up and found it was the only way I could breath ok. Since it was in the early hours of the morning and my partner's a light sleeper, I went to the bathroom. I sat upright, making sure to breath properly, slowly. I did this until I felt an improvement and then returned to bed. I did notice in the morning, when I woke up, that I was short of breath.
                I logged this with my doctor app, and they sent me an asthma inhaler and breathing chamber. I was completely new to this so I asked the pharmacist but he came across as being very dismissive. It was clear they didn't want to spend a lot of time on one person, as it could create a Queue.
                So I went looking on YouTube and found a very helpful video which helped me figure out how to use the asthma inhaler.</p>

            <p>
                In the weeks that followed, I found that when going to sleep or waking up in the morning, I would feel out of breath and my chest was tight so I would use the inhaler.
                I found that it took around 2-3 weeks to pass before I was back to my usual self. Apart from feeling out of breath and having a tight chest, I had no other symptoms at all, apart from the rashes.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do not know if I have ever had Covid since the tests weren't available when I felt unwell in March. In March, I did had a dry cough, sore throat and it seems I had a minor temperate when I was in hospital later in that month. These symptoms were minor, yet combined with the symptoms that followed definitely have me curious if I've had Covid.
                This isn't a certainty as rashes and asthma symptoms can be caused by, and linked to, other factors.</p>

            <p>
                But wait...there's more! In August, on a Saturday in August I found that my left ankle was noticably swollen. I logged it on the doctor app, and then proceeded to play computer games with my legs elevated on a chair. During the course of the day, I got feedback from the clinic that they do not have any available appointments. I should contact the NHS 111 service, so I contacted them and organised an appointment with a doctor at a hospital not too far from me.
                I caught an uber as it felt safer than using the underground. The doctor saw my leg and since I had Deep Vein Thrombis last year, she was not taking any chances. She referred me to another hospital nearby, for them to run further tests. This time I was not taking any chances; I caught the uber home, packed some clothes and then caught an uber to the hospital in question.
                The doctor examined my leg, so I asked her to examine my stomach too. She ordered a few tests, including a blood test. The test results came back and I didn't have another DVT. The doctor was very nice and we had a short conversation but I completely forgot about my stomach and ended up not following up on that, sadly. She did mention that it's likely for the ankle to swell up due to the heat.
                Our apartment did get pretty hot in the summer, even with a fan, so I can understand that. Sadly no info on my stomach or what to do to address that situation. </p>

            <p>
                I can definitely say I've grown an appreciation for medical science over the past two years. Every time I experience a new medical-related challenge, I try do a little research into what could be going wrong. Medical science is fascinating and there are so many things to learn and understand. Let's just say my brain's been engaged and switched on LOL.
                I could, and probably should, start a page on the things I learn on this medical journey. I can say though that this won't ever likely go beyond a personal interest as I do struggle to absorb large quantities of information. I've taken on Computer programming as a careeer because you study to learn the fundamentals and then learn "on the job" going forward. Yes medical science is similar but there are A LOT more fundamentals to learn and remember!
                As it is I've still yet to understand why:
            <ul>
                <li>This stomach's growing the way it is. </li>
                <li> Why my colon gets sore. </li>
                <li> Why my skin is getting these rashes on my hands, under my right knee, and on my right foot. </li>
                <li> Why I got those asthma related symtoms. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                I can definitely say that gluten doesn't do any good for my stomach as a bowl of pasta seems to induce a 3 day recognizable bloating "session". It also seems like my metabolism has definitely slowed down this year and I do appear to be more sensitive to sugar.
                So I do try to make meals which don't include gluten and occassionally we'll have a meal including gluten, though of late we've been terrible at this.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mid September, I found that my big toe (left foot) was starting to swell up a little around the nail on the left side, and at the back of the toe on the left side. I logged this on the doctor's app and they prescribed antibiotics. Honestly I'm not a fan of antibiotics - they're a nuclear weapon, only to be used as a last resort in my opinion. I waited a week with no change so I started taking the antibiotics. Yet once I completed the treatment, I found that it took away some of the pain but it little impact on the swelling itself.
                So I took to YouTube... I found that it was most likely an ingrown nail and I just have to soak the foot in warm water with maybe teatree oil. Sadly I don't really have the means to do that as my bath can't hold water. Looks like I'll have to solve that problem: finding the correct washer for the bath plug. *Sigh!*
            </p>


            <p> My partner and I were trying to follow an intermittent fast where we eat from 12pm-8pm and then not eat for 16 hours. However when I was prescribed antibiotics for my toe, I knew I'd need to take probiotics alongside it. Probiotics are taken with food, and according to the pamphlet, you should take the probiotics preferably in the morning. That threw my fast out the window.
                Now that I've worked through the antibiotics and probiotic treatment, I've been trying to get back into the fast routine but sadly not always being successful.
            </p>

            <p>
                What's with doctors and not prescribing probiotics? Is it not common practice to recommend or even prescribe probiotics for a patient when prescribing antibiotics? I get that its not necessarily needed to prescribe the probiotics but surely you want to at least advise a patient to take the probiotics alongside antibiotics, to help them minimize the damage.
                After all the antibiotics throw off the body's bacteria balance, so it makes sense (at least for me) to help the body restore that balance?
                If a patient doesn't know to take probiotics alongside antibiotics, and neither the doctor or pharmacist doesn't recommend it, then the individual can suffer a whole range of conseequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know of one person who, after taking antibiotics, became allergic to eggs. This person not only has to avoid eggs but every baked good that includes eggs, for the rest of his life.
                A close friend of mine has been experiencing gut-related symptoms for over a year, and the doctors couldn't figure out what was causing her pain and discomfort. She was prescribed a 3 week treatment of antibiotics and there was no mention of taking probiotics at all. Thankfully she had a probiotic yoghurt included in her diet.
                She's coming close to that 3 week mark and the doctors are non-the-wiser as to why she's feeling unwell. Antibiotics should not be the go-to solution wherever there's a problem, especially when it's gut-related or the patient is experiencing gut-related symptoms.
                Sadly one doctor can't talk for the actions of another doctor but I'd really like to know why this happens. No conspiracies though! I'd prefer to get answers from medical practicioners who can give the science behind their actions.

            <h2> 2019 </h2>
            <p>
                My story begins in the last week of December 2018. I had excrutiating pain pulsating from my right side, just above the hip. It was unrelenting and intense. I had moved to stay with my partner six months prior but I had yet to find a local doctor. So my partner took me to a physio as they had an available session. After examining me, the physio confirmed that this was just muscle related and I should see a doctor.
                So my doctor called the doctor practice, where he was registered and they referred him to the practice next door. He managed to organize an appointment for me. After examining me, the doctor didn't know what the exact cause was. So she had referred me for a few tests, including a scan of my stomach. The results showed that I was severly constipated and we began the required treatment. It took a few weeks for the pain to fully subside so I can say I definitely appreciated the heat therapy: a hot water bottle covered in a towel LOL. </p>

            <p> Let's just say that pain on that level definitely puts everything else in perspective! It also means, however, that one has to be careful before dismissing pains on a lower pain level, just because they're manageable.</p>

            <p>
                Later that year, on a Friday afternoon in April, I was walking around the mall on a lunch break. Something bizarre happened: when I walked past someone, their leg got caught on mine and I was hanging in the area until the gentleman realized what was going on and released my foot. He was apologized and we both went about our day.
                Nothing was out of the ordinary for the rest of that day and for the most part of the next day. I did find that my left foot became be somewhat uncomfortable in my shoes to the end of my work shift. I finished work at 9pm and got home around 9:30pm.
                As soon as I got home, I couldnt wait to take my shoes off and relax. Within 30 mins of taking the shoes off, my left foot got so swollen that it was recognizably bigger in size. When I tried to walk on my foot, it was really sore. I took anti-inflammatories and managed to get a good night's rest.
                Since my foot swelled up on a Saturday evening, the doctor practices were all closed so I had no way of getting off work for the next 2 days. So I went into work, limping and all. My manager had no authority to send me home so I did my best to move around in the pain, with the help of Ibuprofen and Paracetamol.
                I found my feet got incredibly hot in the shoes, so in my lunch break I bought an ankle sock from the pharmacy, which helped keep my foot cool.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the painkillers and anti-inflammatories helped with the pain and discomfort, I decided to spend the Tuesday relaxing as it was the only day I had off that week, until the following weekend. I decided not to see a doctor as I figured I had sprain my ankle and it just needed time to heal. I just had to work out the remaining 2 weeks until my leave and then I could give my foot all the rest it needed.
                Our holiday started with us driving to a different city, in a different province, to spend some time with my partner's dad and his partner. I would keep my foot up during the day, but I started to notice the pain would go down when I went for a gentle walk. At the end of the first week I found my foot was feeling better for the most part, I could walk on it comfortably so we went for a walk and it became a bit of a light hike through a forest. I loved it! I started noticing my feet were getting a little tired, so we made our way back to the holiday house.
                The next day we saw that the foot not only got more sore, but the swelling increased and it was spreading to the rest of the leg. We decided it was best to make our way back to our home in Cape Town. So we drove back on the Tuesday, and got home in the early evening.</p>

            <p>
                Sadly the next day was a public holiday as the government decided to make sure everyone has the opportunity to vote. Sadly this meant the doctor practices were all closed.
                Knowing what I know now, it would have been wise for us to go to the hospital that Tuesday evening when we arrived home, or even the Wednesday evening. We called in first thing on the Thursday morning and booked an appointment with the doctor.
                The doctor who assisted me was young but she was also straight out of working in a hospital. So she saw my leg, told me that there was a possibility it could a Deep Vein Thrombosis. She was right! She referred me to the nearest practice where I could have an ultrascan done of my leg. I lit up like a christmas tree - I had several blood clots in the deep veins of my leg.
                I returned to the doctor but since I had found it so hard & painful to walk up the small incline to the doctor's office, my partner walked into the practice and asked the doctor if she wouldn't mind coming to the car. She gladly (and kindly) agreed to do so and she told me that the best course of action was to go to the nearest hospital, straight away. She gave me the referral papers, and the results of the ultrascan.
                With this we drove directly to the hospital. We arrived around 5pm and I got my bed around 1am the next day. At some point during that waiting period, my partner went home and packed a bag for me - including all my essentials, clothes and some treats as well. My mom also came to support me while we were waiting for a bed.
                I ended up spending a week in the hospital from when I arrived on the Thursday evening to the following week Friday afternoon. For the first three days I received Heparin injections and going forward I was given Warfarin.
            </p>

            <p>
                The drama didn't end there. The next chapter involved getting regular blood tests and I hated having my blood drawn. As I came out of hospital, I had an appointment the next day to get my blood drawn at a local clinic.
                I didn't have a great experience, as the nurses and doctors struggled to draw the required blood. My blood supply seemed non-existent and in the end, despite a doctor getting the required 4ml blood, it was invalid by the time it reached the labs.
                I felt so stressed out, and traumatised that my partner treated me to a coffee and pastry at a really good cafe on the way home. It was so good, that it became the regular after each blood test.
                Going forward, I decided that despite the price I would rather go to a private clinic to get my blood drawn. I am definitly glad I did this! The nurses managed to draw my blood far more effortlessly. I can definitely say I appreciate a butterfly needle makes the world of a difference!
                In most cases, it was the needle more so than the doctor themself. I say that after having doctors in a local clinic draw blood for my thyroid tests, whilst having an intense conversation with a colleague. I've often walked away from those with a bruise, without the help of warfarin!
            </p>

            <p>
                I went through this until around August that year. I was emigrating out the country so I had a conversation with my doctor and she recommended another blood thinner which didn't require the regular blood tests that warfarin did. I bought special stockings for the drive around South Africa and for the flight to the UK.
                The doctor, at the hospital, booked me off for a month and I definitely needed it! The swelling on my legs went down after 2 weeks and the swelling on my knees and thighs only really subsided after 3 weeks - from the time I was at home.
                I went for a walk once a day, even tho in the beginning it took around 30 mins just to walk a short distance and turn around. After looking on YouTube, I found a helpful video for people recovering from a DVT. I did the exercises daily and it definitely found it helpful.
                By the 4th week I was able to walk up and down the hill at a decent pace. So I was ready to return to work, yet I did find that working the 12 hours was hard on my foot.
            </p>

            <p>
                I communicated this to my manager and he made a plan to accommodate me. I did however find that the company itself were not flexible in my situation. I had asked the company's HR if I could adjust my shifts so that I work the same number of work hours spread out over the week so that I only worked 8 hours a day. The head of HR said she'd try find another store where I could work. However she went quiet, did nothing and avoided us both. So my manager did some digging and found that the store that the head of HR had in mind had no vacancies and none of their sales consultants wanted to move to a different branch, to allow for an exchange. My manager pressed HR, only to have them say that no store had a vacancy for me and they can't do anything.
                So my manager decided to speak to the regional manager and he managed to work out a shift rosta for me, which allowed me to work 8-5pm every day. This way I could go home and rest my leg before the next day's shift. I became the person who was responsible, on a daily basis, for ensuring our serialised stock was all accounted for. I definitely appreciated the responsibility, as I was already doing this whenever I started my shift in the morning, and it was one less matter he needed to take care of.
                This was possible, in part, because I was only due to work one more month at the company and partly because I had worked with both the manager and regional manager before for more than three years. So they both had a good sense of my character and the level of commitment I gave to my work.

            <p> Some medical jargon:
                These blood tests were specifically to measure my INR (International Normalised Ration): how long it takes my blood to form a clot. In the beginning your body forms cloths far too quickly, so the anti-coogulants / blood thinners are designed to thin the blood out. By keeping the blood thin, the doctors can ensure your body can flow freely around your body, allowing the body to heal or even redirect the blood around the body if needed.
                Their aim is for your body to hit that healthy balance so the doctors have to customize the dose of warfarin according to how quickly the blood clots in your body.
                As the body heals, and takes less time to clot, you need less and less warfarin. Another interesting fact is that the doctor drawing the blood, for this test, has to successfully get 4ml of blood in one go. If it drips in slowly, there's a likelihood the blood will thicken before it gets to the laboratories. If this happens, the blood is deemed invalid and the test will need to be repeated. </p>

            <p>
                After I had taken blood thinners for six months, I booked an appointment with the doctor. The doctor decided, in my situation, six months would be sufficient and I could stop taking the blood thinners altogether. I was super happy about this! </p>

                There are a few things that I learnt from all of this:
                <ul>
                    <li> Before going for a blood test, make sure to drink plenty fluids and have something to eat so you feel satiated. </li>
                    <li> Anxiety can make it harder both to find a vein and to actually draw blood from the vein.</li>
                    <li> There are significant number of interactions between warfarin and other drugs. Make use of drugs.com and check a drug/medicine for interactions before taking them. I ended up taking my thyroid medicine in the morning and the warfarin in the evenings, so that warfarin didn't cancel out the thyroid medication. </li>
                    <li> If your foot is swollen, go see a doctor as soon as you can. Don't make the assumption that it's "just" a sprain ankle.</li>
                    <li> When on warfarin, you will bruise easily and often you will bruise whenever a nurse takes blood from you, unless they're really gentle.</li>
                    <li> If a part of your body's in pain, no matter the pain level, take it seriously and deal with it before it gets worse. </li>
                    <li> Love yourself more than you love the company you work for. Your work is replaceable but your health isn't! So if you find a company cannot, or don't want to, accomodate your health issues/needs then if you have an opportunity to change jobs, do so! </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I can definitely say I miss the 2 doctors in that practice! They were legendary and very supportive. I definitely miss the personal connection that comes with having a private doctor. Public doctors simply don't have the time to have that sort of personal relationships with patients.
                Sadly due to my finances, private doctors in the UK are out of my price range.
