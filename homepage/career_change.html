        <p> I would like to share with you, my journey thus far to change careers.</p>

        <p> I decided a few years ago that working as a sales consultant was no longer working for me.
            So I decided to find another career that would be challenging, mentally stimulating and would fit in with my values.
            I decided to go in the direction of software engineering, but not set myself into any specific speciality until I had actually worked in several different fields or have found one specific field that resonates with me.
            I chose software engineering because it's a combination of creation and maintenance. Each company and each role has their balance of these two elements.
            Personally, I enjoy both creating and fixing things so either way I believe Software engineering has the potential to be fantastic!

            In Dec 2018, I started a course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming">Introduction to Python programming</a>. It's a Georgia Tech course via the online education platform edX.
            It consists of 4 smaller courses, which together form a professional certificate. It took me a little over a year to complete but I did so with fantastic grades and a great recommendation from Georgia Tech's Executive Director, David Joyner.
            This recommendation can be found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/acfolgado/">my Linkedin page.</a>
            The course covered the fundamentals of computer programming with Python as the programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
            It covered:
            <ol>
                <li> Debugging, variables, logical & mathematical operators. </li>
                <li> Conditionals, loops, functions, & error handling.</li>
                <li> Data structures, strings, lists, file input & output, & dictionaries. </li>
                <li> Objects & algorithms</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon completing this course, I went onto to start a Harvard course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a>.
            This course was also offered on edX's online platform. The version through edX however covers Python, not PHP.
            This course also covers the fundamentals so it overlaps with the prior course. What has made this course interesting for me is that it covers this material over several programming languages:
            <ul>
                <li> Scratch</li>
                <li> C</li>
                <li> Python</li>
                <li> SQL</li>
                <li> HTML, CSS & JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The course also shows you how to do the same task over several languages. A great thing about this course is that because it covers the programming language C, it also touches on:
            <ul>
                <li> Memory allocation</li>
                <li> The importance of not wasting computer memory when writing code (memory leaks). </li>
                <li> File pointers </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The course also covered general fundamental topics not covered in the Georgia Tech course:
            <ul>
                <li> Call Stacks </li>
                <li> Hash tables </li>
                <li> String-linked lists </li>
                <li> Command line arguments</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I've definitely appreciated both courses for different reasons. Both have added substantial value to my learning development and my understanding of the Computer programming fundamentals.
            As of October 2020, I am currently working through the Web track part of the course, which called for me to create a website with 4 linked webpages.
