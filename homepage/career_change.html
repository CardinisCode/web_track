            <h1> My Career change journey </h1>

            <p> I would like to share with you, my journey thus far to change careers.</p>

            <p> 
                I decided a few years ago that working as a sales consultant was no longer working for me.
                So I decided to find another career that would be challenging, mentally stimulating and would fit in with my values.
                I decided to go in the direction of software engineering, but not set myself into any specific speciality until I had actually worked in several different fields or have found one specific field that resonates with me.
                I chose software engineering because it's a combination of creation and maintenance. Each company and each role has their balance of these two elements.
                Personally, I enjoy both creating and fixing things so either way I believe Software engineering has the potential to be fantastic!

                In Dec 2018, I started a course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming">Introduction to Python programming</a>. It's a Georgia Tech course via the online education platform edX.
                It consists of 4 smaller courses, which together form a professional certificate. It took me a little over a year to complete but I did so with fantastic grades and a great recommendation from Georgia Tech's Executive Director, David Joyner.
                This recommendation can be found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/acfolgado/">my Linkedin page.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The course covered the fundamentals of computer programming with Python as the programming language:
                <ol>
                    <li> Debugging, variables, logical & mathematical operators. </li>
                    <li> Conditionals, loops, functions, & error handling.</li>
                    <li> Data structures, strings, lists, file input & output, & dictionaries. </li>
                    <li> Objects & algorithms</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon completing this course, I went onto to start a Harvard course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a>.
                As this course also covers the fundamentals, it overlaps with the prior course. What has made this course interesting for me is that it covers this material over several programming languages:
                <ul>
                    <li> Scratch</li>
                    <li> C</li>
                    <li> Python</li>
                    <li> SQL</li>
                    <li> HTML, CSS & JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                A great thing about this course is that because it covers the programming language C, it also touches on:
                <ul>
                    <li> Memory allocation</li>
                    <li> The importance of not wasting computer memory when writing code (memory leaks). </li>
                    <li> File pointers </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The course also covered general fundamental topics not covered in the Georgia Tech course:
                <ul>
                    <li> Call Stacks </li>
                    <li> Hash tables </li>
                    <li> String-linked lists </li>
                    <li> Command line arguments</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                I've definitely appreciated both courses for different reasons. Both have added substantial value to my learning development and my understanding of the Computer programming fundamentals.
                As of October 2020, I am currently working through the Web track part of the course, which called for me to create a website with 4 linked webpages.
